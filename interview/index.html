<h2> K- What area of special effects do you hope to work in? </h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
<p>R- Props and some of the shop work (sculpting and painting). To me with my Bachelor of Fine Arts I have more of a background in that kind of stuff and I find it way more interesting then the on-set stuff.</p>

<div class="q">
<h2> K- What attributes make for a good special effects artist? </h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
<p>R- Hard working, creativity, the ability to constantly learn, and to be able to take criticism well. Also, the ability to not be upset if the prop or thing your working on does not make the cut and get used on the project.</p>

<div class="q">
<h2> K- Is it hard to get into the special effects field? </h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
<p>R- It is defiantly a very specific field. The programs are small and there is a lot of competition amongst them. In my class about 5 people from my graduating class will be lucky to find work in the field because the jobs are very limited.</p>

<section>
<div class="q">
<h2> K- What excites you about the field then? </h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
<p>R- To me the ability to just create something so real that adults act in a child like manor questioning if something is real or not really get me excited. The ability to constantly learn new techniques, how to make something work better for the next time and just be creative is what gets me really interested and engaged in this field of work.</p>

<section>
<div class="q">
<h2> K- What are some words of wisdom you would give to someone who is an aspiring special effects artist? </h2>
</div>

<div class= "a">
<p>R- Always use reference photos
Always question what you could do better for next time
Using fake blood to try and hide edges in make up does not work, you are not fooling anyone
That its going to be a very hard road but if this is something you are passionate about you can make it work.<p>
